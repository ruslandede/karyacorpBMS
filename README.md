At Karya Corp, I contributed as a Business Analyst in a 4-month project developing a building management system that operates on both Android and web platforms. 
This system streamlines building maintenance by enabling mobile management and offering an admin interface on the web. 
Leading the business analysis aspect, I developed essential documentation, including flowcharts, ER diagrams, and the Business Requirements Document (BRD), to align our teamâ€™s objectives and ensure a smooth development process. 
Our team of four collaborated closely to deliver an efficient and user-friendly solution.
